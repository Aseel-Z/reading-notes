#  Pythonisms

# Dunder (Magic, Special) Methods

- Definition: 
 > a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because   they start and end with double underscores,
- Example: __init__ or __str__
- Useful, but it's recommended not to over use them.

#### Object Initialization: __init__
#### Object Representation: __str__, __repr__
#### Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__
#### Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: __eq__, __lt__
#### Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: __add__
#### Callable Python Objects: __call__
#### Context Manager Support and the With Statement: __enter__, __exit__


# Python Iterators
> Iterators provide a sequence interface to Python objects thatâ€™s memory efficient and considered Pythonic. Behold the beauty of the for-in loop!
> To support iteration an object needs to implement the iterator protocol by providing the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods.
> Class-based iterators are only one way to write iterable objects in Python. Also consider generators and generator expressions.

# Python Generators

- ## Code Example 1(without and with using Python Generators):
 > class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        return self.value

 > def repeater(value):
    while True:
        yield value

- ## Code Example 2:
> def repeat_three_times(value):
    yield value
    yield value
    yield value

> >>> iterator = repeat_three_times('Hey there')
>>> next(iterator)
'Hey there'
>>> next(iterator)
'Hey there'
>>> next(iterator)
'Hey there'
>>> next(iterator)
StopIteration
>>> next(iterator)
StopIteration

# CSS Layouts
- CSS views each HTML element as 'boxes'.
- 'Boxes' can either be on a block level (e.g. **h1**/**p**/**ul** ) or a in-line level (e.g. **img**/**b**/**i**). 
- **Containing/Parent Elements** are the elements that are inclusive to ther elements.
- In CSS there are 3 positioning schemes:
  - Normal Flow
  - Relative Positioning
  - Absolute Positioning
- >The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

- layouts can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) .
- Using Grids enables creating high quality flexible designs.
- > CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

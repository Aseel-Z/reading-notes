# Basic Statistics in Python — Probability
 - probability is how likely it is for something to happen; the chance of event occurence
 - normal distribution: 2D bell shaped, symmetrical graph in which the x-axis represents the values of events and the y-axis represents the   probability associated with each event, from 0 to 1.

 ### Central Limit Theorem

 ### Z-score
> The Z-score is a simple calculation that answers the question, “Given a data point, how many standard deviations is it away from the mean?” The equation below is the Z-score equation

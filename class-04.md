# HTML LINKS
- links are added using the element *a*.
- using the attribute href the URL is added.
- between the a tags the text is added.
- URLs can relative'on the same site' or absolute.
- Directory Structure "child-parent-grandparent"
- email links can be added using the *mailto*
- > You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

# CSS Layouts
- CSS views each HTML element as 'boxes'.
- 'Boxes' can either be on a block level (e.g. **h1**/**p**/**ul** ) or a in-line level (e.g. **img**/**b**/**i**). 
- **Containing/Parent Elements** are the elements that are inclusive to ther elements.
- In CSS there are 3 positioning schemes:
  - Normal Flow
  - Relative Positioning
  - Absolute Positioning
- >The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

- layouts can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) .
- Using Grids enables creating high quality flexible designs.
- > CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.


# JS - Functions, Methods, and Objects

## Functions?
- A series of statemnets that performs a specific task that can be reused several times.

## Function Declaring - The Syntax:
  - function *function name* {
    Block of statements to be executed
    return statement *"Optional"*
  }

## Calling a Function - The Syntax:
  - *function name* (paramneters"input" *"Optional"*);

## Note:
- Make sure to declare the variables used with in the function. 

## Global Vs. Local:
- Variables Scope can be either Local; function level, or Global; outside the the fucntion.

# Pair Programming
- It is a commonly used technique in many Agile working sets, in Software Development.
- It provides you with the blended benefit of using iterative loops, code reviews, fast feedback, and error checking, as well.
- It includes two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
- >The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
- >The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 
- Pair Programming has many benefits, summarized as follows:
   - Better efficiency
   - Engaged collaboration
   - Collaborative learning
   - Social skills
   - Preparing you for job interviews & work environments

# JavaScript - Operators and Loops:

## When making a condition-based-decision, Comparison and Logical Opertators can be used:

### We have 8 Comparison Opertators (reaturn single boolean value):
- == : equal to by value
- ===: strictly equal to by value and type
- !== : not equal to by value
- !===: not strictly equal to by value and type
-  '>':greater than
-  '>=':greater than or equal
-  '<':less than
-  '<=':less than or equal

### Logical Opertators (allow the comparison of more than one comparison operators):
- && : AND 
- || : OR
- ! : NOT

### LOOPS (FOR - WHILE - DO WHILE)
- Loops allow the execution of a code block for a specified number of times, as long as the condition returns a TRUE value.
- A Loop Counter consists of three main elements: (Intialization Variable - Condition - Counter Update)

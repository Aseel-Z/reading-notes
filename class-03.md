# HTML LISTS:

## There are Three Types of HTML Lists:

- **Ordered Lists** are created using "ol" tags, and each list item lies between "li" tags.
- **Unordered Lists** are created using "ul" tags, and each list item lies between "li" tags.
- **Definition Lists** are lists that include terms along with their definitions, and are created using "d1" tags; such that the "dt" tags include the terms and the "dd" tags include the definitions.

*Lists can be nested; a list/lits can be created inside another list*

# CSS BOXES:

- In CSS, each element is viewed as if it is a box.
- Box Dimentions (Height,Width)
  >height: 300px;
   width: 300px;
      OR 
   height: 75%;
   width: 75%;

- Limiting Width "min-width, max-width"
- Limiting Height "min-Height, max-Height"
- Overflowing content can be either hidden or scrolled.
- Border, Margin & Padding, are three properties that control the appearance of the box.
- Content can be centered using the *text-align* property.
- Boxes can be hidden or visible using the *visibility* property.
- >CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders
- >Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

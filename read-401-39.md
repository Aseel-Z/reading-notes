# NEXT.JS

### when building an app using react, the following has to be taken into consideration

> - Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
> - You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
> - You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side   rendering or client-side rendering.
> - You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

- One solution to this problem is using a high level of abstraction framework, i.e _NEXT.JS_.

## Next.js: The React Framework
> Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

> An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
> Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
> Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
> Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
> Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
> Development environment with Fast Refresh support
> API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
> Fully extendable

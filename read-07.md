# APIs continued 

## HTTP
- HTTP, tells the browsers what protocol to use.
- HTTP, is equivalent to the http; that is the start of any webpage address.
- HTTP, is an important breakthrough in the computing history, because it works like GPS coordinates; determines one's location.

## REST
- REST is an architectural style, that is the basis of the world wide web.
- > REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
- > A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser

## APIs or Web Services
- an acronym for (Application Programming Interface).
- in APIs the front end stands still, and the computer does the job of requesting and recieving data from other computers and sending them back to the front end.
- URLs are equivalent to nonus; computer names.
- redirect is basically computers taliking to each other.
- Ruby on Rails is a "RESTful web framework".
- so basically we tell the web framework, in what form we want the data, and it does all of the communication.
